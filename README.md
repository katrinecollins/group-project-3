Group Project 3

Covid Conquerors

The team consists of Ryan Szczepanski, Heather Kirkness, Xavier Fegan, and Katrine Collins; RS, HK, XR, and KC for note taking purposes. Our full stack, third group project, is a website that has a signin/signup, logout, comment, and a game with a leaderboard. The repository was set up by RS and cloned by HK, XF, and KC. The files from Module 22 were used as a base from the project. RS developed an "Asteroids" inspired game to combate covid germs with a scientist that shoots syringes with javascript. HK worked on the UI and thought and delete buttons. XF worked on the back end of the project. KC worked on and Covid API for future use that will display current Covid information on the login page. KC became repository owner, and HK and XF cloned the new forked repository. KC deployed to Heruku and used MongoDB.

To utilize the website, the user will need to create, a user id and login information, then they will be able to play the game, and get on the leaderboard for high scores. The information will be saved through the login and the user will be able to keep working on their high score.
